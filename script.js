  "Even if today felt heavy, you still carried yourself through it. That matters more than you know.", 
  "Youâ€™re not behind. Youâ€™re just on your own path, walking at your own pace. I believe in that pace, and I believe in you.",
   "Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with needing rest or comfort. That doesnâ€™t make you weak, youâ€™re still strong, still worthy, always.",
   "You donâ€™t have to feel okay all the time to be doing okay. I see the quiet ways youâ€™re healing, even when you canâ€™t",
   "Some days you bloom, other days you just breathe. Both are important. Both are beautiful. I am here for both.",
   "You donâ€™t always have to be strong. Itâ€™s okay to soften. Let yourself rest. Iâ€™ve got you.",
   "You donâ€™t owe anyone an explanation for your tiredness. Life gets heavy. Just surviving it is already a lot and Iâ€™m proud of you.",
   "Itâ€™s okay if you donâ€™t feel bright today. Even cloudy skies are full of meaning and so are you, always.",
   "Youâ€™re not a burden for feeling deeply. I know you canâ€™t always find the words, and thatâ€™s okay. Just know Iâ€™m here. I always will be.",
   "Youâ€™re not broken. You donâ€™t need fixing. Youâ€™re still growing, even in the unseen places.",
   "Youâ€™ve done hard things before, Iâ€™ve seen your strength. Youâ€™ll get through this too, one breath at a time.",
   "Just because itâ€™s slow doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not real. Youâ€™re growing quietly, and that still counts.",
   "Growth doesnâ€™t need to be perfect or loud. It just needs you, and youâ€™re doing more than you know.",
   "This isnâ€™t the end. Itâ€™s just a pause. Thereâ€™s so much still waiting for you, even if itâ€™s not visible right now.",
   "There is light ahead, even if you canâ€™t feel it yet. Iâ€™ll help you hold on. Just take it one step at a time.",
   "What feels unclear today might make sense tomorrow, sometimes understanding just needs a little time, and thatâ€™s okay.",
   "Itâ€™s okay not to have the next step figured out. Sometimes just resting is part of moving forward.",
   "Life is still unfolding for you, and I love watching it happen. You donâ€™t have to rush your story.",
   "The storm wonâ€™t last forever. Let this moment pass without trying to make it mean something. Iâ€™m right here through all of it.",
   "Youâ€™re allowed to start over, as many times as you need, Iâ€™ll be here every time.",
   "You are not alone in this. Iâ€™m here, holding space for you, even when words feel too heavy.",
   "Your feelings are real, and youâ€™re allowed to feel all of them. You donâ€™t have to carry it alone, not while Iâ€™m here.",
   "You are not your struggles. Youâ€™re so much more, I see it in every little thing you do, I hope one day you do too.",
   "You are not the weight of what youâ€™ve been through. Youâ€™re the love you give, the light you still carry, even on hard days.",
   "You donâ€™t have to prove anything to be loved. I hope you know that youâ€™re already enough, I love you just as you are.",
   "You donâ€™t have to earn your worth through doing. You matter because youâ€™re you. Thatâ€™s enough for me.",
   "Youâ€™re loved in small ways, in quiet moments, in things left unsaid, in the spaces between. Itâ€™s there. I promise. Iâ€™m here.",
   "You matter to me in ways I canâ€™t always put into words. Just wanted you to know Iâ€™m so glad you're part of my world.",
   "You are loved, even when you canâ€™t feel it. Iâ€™m here, holding that love for you until you can see it again.",
   "You donâ€™t have to have it all together to be loved. Youâ€™re allowed to struggle and Iâ€™ll hold you together for a while if you need.",
   "Even if you donâ€™t see it, I do, youâ€™re still showing up, still trying, and that matters. Youâ€™re doing better than you think",
   "Youâ€™ve made it through things you thought would break you. And here you are. Thatâ€™s something I admire every single day.",
   "Even if it feels small, the effort youâ€™re giving matters. Youâ€™re doing your best and thatâ€™s more than enough for me.",
   "Even when itâ€™s quiet and everything feels far away, youâ€™re not alone. Iâ€™m here. Always.",
   "You havenâ€™t lost any part of yourself that matters even if the light feels dim, itâ€™s still there. So are you"
